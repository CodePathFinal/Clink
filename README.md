## Overview
### Description
This app offers a way for people to create large bulk orders of drinks at bars and have an easy way to present those orders to the bartender. Users 'clink' their accounts together with one user being the host. Once the host collects the order of the group they are with then they present the order to the bartender making it easy to remember/show the bartender. Also, when two users clink their apps together, they share a little pop up with their social media links and profiles on it.
